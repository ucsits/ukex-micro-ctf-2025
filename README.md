Explanation:

1. **\<name>** is the name of the challenge to be created.  
2. **release** is the folder for the attachments to be given to the participants.  
3. **source** is the folder used to store the original challenge source code, and if it’s a service, this folder will be deployed to the server.

> Why does the source folder need another \<name>?  
> To avoid conflicts in docker compose so they don’t sync with each other
